        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is a meatball recipe that I learned from my best friend.</p>
            <p>I always try to use fresh herbs when making this dish, as they really impact the flavor.</p>
            <p>Also I usually substitute in oat milk and potatoe bread, due to my girlfriend's food allergies.</p>
            <p>So feel free to play around with the ingredients in this recipe and see what works.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3lbs Ground Beef</li>
                <li>2 Slices White Bread</li>
                <li>2 Eggs</li>

                <li>1/2 Cup Basil</li>
                <li>1/2 Cup Thyme</li>

            </ul>
        
            <h3>Recipe</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rip apart the bread into small strips and soak in milk.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine ground beef, eggs and soaked bread. Make sure not to add the excess milk to the meat.</li>
                    <li>Add half of the chopped basil, thyme, oregano and parsley to the meat. Keep the other half to the side.</li>
                    <li>Form small meatballs and set aside on a large plate or baking pan.</li>
                    <li>Over medium-high heat, brown meatballs on all sides in a large, cast iron skillet.</li>
                    <li>Once the meatballs are browned, mix both jars of tomato sauce and the rest of the herbs in the cast iron with the meatballs.</li>
                    <li>Cover the pan and braise the meatballs over medium-low heat, for 30 minutes or until they reach an internal temperature of 165 F.</li>
                    <li>Once the meatballs are finished, salt and pepper the sauce to taste and serve with fresh pasta. Enjoy!</li>
