        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is a Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe that I found on joyfoodsunshine.com.</p>
            <p>I've used this recipe for years and the cookies always come out fantastic!</p>
            <p>However, they are super rich, so you could always cut back on the sugar in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Cup Salted Butter</li>
                <li>1 Cup Sugar</li>
                <li>1 Cup Brown Sugar</li>
                <li>2 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
                <li>3 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp Baking Soda</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp Baking Powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp Sea Salt</li>
                <li>2 Cups of Chocolate Chips</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cream together the butter and sugars until they are well combined and smooth.</li>
                <li>Beat in the eggs and add the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.</li>
                <li>Then slowly mix the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until the dough is formed.</li>
                <li>Add the chocolate chips to the dough, then portion out small balls of dough onto a baking pan.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 F and bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes, or until they just start to brown.</li>
            </ol>
